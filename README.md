Task 1 is about the number-guessing game in which the computer will generate a random number and the user has to guess it.
It hints whether the number given by the user is smaller or larger than the random number or if the number we guessed is correct.


Task 2 is about a calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
division. Allow the user to input two numbers and choose an operation to perform.
